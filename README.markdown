# Recommendable [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/davidcelis/recommendable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/davidcelis/recommendable)

Recommendable is an engine for Rails 3 applications to quickly add the ability for your users to Like/Dislike items and receive recommendations for new items. It uses Redis to store your recommendations and keep them sorted by how good the recommendation is.

Installation
------------

Add the following to your Rails application's `Gemfile`:

``` ruby
  gem "recommendable", :git => "git://github.com/davidcelis/recommendable"
```

After bundling, run the installation generator:

``` bash
$ rails g recommendable:install
```

Double check `config/initializers/recommendable.rb` for options on configuring your Redis connection. After a user likes or dislikes something new, they are placed in a Sidekiq queue to have their recommendation updated. Start up sidekiq like so:

``` bash
$ bundle exec sidekiq
```

You can run this command multiple times if you wish to start more than one
worker. For more information on sidekiq, head over to [mperham][sidekiq].

Usage
-----

In your Rails model that will be receiving recommendations:

``` ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  recommends :movies, :shows, :other_things
  
  # ...
end
```

That's it! Please note, however, that you may only do this in one model at this time.

For more details on how to use Recommendable once it's installed and configured, [check out the more detailed README][recommendable] or see the [documentation][documentation].

Installing Redis
----------------

Recommendable requires Redis to deliver recommendations. The collaborative filtering logic is based almost entirely on set math, and Redis is blazing fast for this. _NOTE: Your redis database MUST be persistent._

### Homebrew

For Mac OS X users, homebrew is by far the easiest way to install Redis.

``` bash
$ brew install redis
```

Redis will now be running on localhost:6379. After a second, you can hit `ctrl-\` to detach and keep Redis running in the background.
